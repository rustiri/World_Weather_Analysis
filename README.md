# World Weather Analysis with Python APIs
The purpose of this project is to create an app to analyze weather data on specific cities based on a customer's travel preference. By using Google Map Direction, customer can also see the travel route between the four cities. The software used in this project were Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, OpenWeatherMap API and Google’s Map API

## Overview of Project
Analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip.

The following tasks to complete:

1.	Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
  *	Use the NumPy module to generate more than 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes.
  *	Use the citipy module to list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.
  * Use the OpenWeatherMap API to request the current weather data from each unique city in your list.
  * Parse the JSON data from the API request.

2.	Visualize Travel Data: Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences i.e. information about the city, current maximum temperature, a hotel in the city and travel mode (driving, walking, bicycling).

## Resources
- Data Sources: Weatherpy_Database.csv and Weatherpy_vacation.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, OpenWeatherMap API and Google’s Map API

## Summary
The customer can use input statement to filter the data for their weather preferences. From the list of potential travel destinations, they can choose four cities to create travel itinerary. By using Google Map Direction, they can also see the travel route between the four cities.
